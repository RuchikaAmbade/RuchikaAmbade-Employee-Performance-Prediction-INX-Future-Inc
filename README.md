# Employee-Performance-Prediction-INX-Future-Inc

This project focuses on analyzing employee performance data to uncover trends, identify key performance drivers, and support data-driven decision-making for human resources and leadership teams. It applies statistical techniques and machine learning models to evaluate individual and team performance, predict future outcomes, and visualize insights in a clear and actionable format.

The analysis was conducted using Python for data cleaning, feature engineering, and modeling. SQL was used for data extraction and transformation, while visualizations were created using Power BI and Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn. Jupyter Notebooks were used for exploratory analysis and documentation of the workflow.

The repository includes raw and processed datasets, notebooks for analysis, Python scripts for automation, and dashboards for visual summaries. All files are organized to ensure clarity and ease of use for collaborators and reviewers.

To get started, clone the repository and set up a Python environment with the required libraries listed in the requirements file. Load your dataset into the appropriate folder and explore the notebooks or run the scripts to generate insights. Dashboards can be viewed directly in Power BI or as static images in the dashboards folder.

Key deliverables include a performance scoring model, feature importance analysis, and a final report summarizing recommendations for improving employee productivity and engagement. This project was developed with a focus on transparency, reproducibility, and practical impact.
